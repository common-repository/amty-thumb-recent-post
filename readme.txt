== Frequently Asked Questions ==



= Only default images are being shown =

Check whether you had optimized your database. Remove sub versions of your posts. It'll not only help to extract exact image but will decrease loading time of your blog.

= Still not able to see resized image =

Check whether you have PHP GD library installed.

No, It supports only jpg,png and gif. I hadn't tested it for others.
